# EasyAI
It is personal project that I will add things as I go.

# Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/aadityamundhalia/easyai.git`
- `cd easyai`
- `docker-compose up -d`

# Ollama
Install a model to install a model you can use `ollama run mistral`
- `docker-compose exec ollama bash`
then run `ollama run mistral` (mistral out performs llama2)

# Marqo
It will take sometime for maqo to load so give it like 5 minutes.

# Stramlit
The server will be loaded on: `localhost:8501`
once on page click on Initialize and click Initialize this will create the indexes.


This project is still work in progress.
